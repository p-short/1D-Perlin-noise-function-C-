I needed one dimensional Perlin noise for a C++ project Im working on, I found it difficult to find an immediate exsisting implementation of 1D noise
and some of the C++ noise libraries I looked into seemed overly complicated and large.

Having started programming in JavaScript I was really familiar with the open source libary p5.js. After looking at the code
for the noise function inside of p5 I realised it was fairly light-weight and had exactly the functionality I needed for my project.
So I adapted the JS to into C++! 

I did not devise this algorithm so it seems right to correctly attribute p5.js https://p5js.org

Thanks!
